# Tomatoes Ripe or Unripe Classification Model

This project classifies tomatoes as either ripe or unripe using a machine learning pipeline that leverages the **VGG19** model for feature extraction, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification. The pipeline integrates fuzzy logic to enhance feature extraction, preprocessing, and standardization of data.

## Overview
This model is designed to automatically classify images of tomatoes as **ripe** or **unripe**. It uses a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract features from tomato images and applies fuzzy logic and PCA for dimensionality reduction before classification with an SVM. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled images and achieved high accuracy in predicting the ripeness of tomatoes.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
```
├── dataset/              # Folder containing tomato images for classification
│   ├── ripe/             # Ripe tomatoes images
│   └── unripe/           # Unripe tomatoes images
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your dataset into two folders: `ripe` and `unripe`, with images of ripe and unripe tomatoes, respectively.

2. **Feature Extraction**: The VGG19 model is used to extract features from the images. The features are flattened and stored as input data for further processing.

3. **Fuzzification**: The extracted features are fuzzified using a mean-based membership function to enhance the model's interpretability.

4. **Preprocessing**: The features are normalized using the `StandardScaler` to ensure consistent scaling.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set to 100 principal components, retaining the most important features.

6. **Classification**: An SVM classifier is used to train on the processed features and classify the images as either ripe or unripe.

7. **Training the Model**: Use the following command to train the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Model Details
1. **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained VGG19 model with `block5_pool` as the output layer is used. The extracted features are flattened into a vector.

2. **Fuzzy Logic**: A fuzzy membership function is applied to the features to create fuzzy features.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is used to reduce the feature space to 100 principal components.

4. **Classification**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the reduced feature space with stratified sampling to ensure an even distribution between classes.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using several performance metrics, including:
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- **Specificity**: The ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Results:
Accuracy: 0.875
Precision: 1.0
Recall (Sensitivity): 0.75
Specificity: 1.0
F1 Score: 0.8571428571428571
